# Hey, I'm Anirudh 👋

**Software Engineer II @ Guidewire** · Building Agentic AI Systems

I build AI systems that ship to production. Currently working on secure microservices and internal AI tooling. Previously deployed an LLM chatbot serving real patients at a hospital in Kerala.

## What I'm Working On

🤖 **Agentic AI Workflows** — Built an autonomous agent at Guidewire that reduced manual workflow time by 80% using LLM orchestration and custom tool integration.

🏥 **Production LLM Chatbot** — End-to-end deployment at AIMS Hospital, Kochi. Full-stack architecture on AWS handling real patient interactions.

🔒 **Sentinel** — Go-based microservices securing the software supply chain through artifact analysis and policy enforcement.

## Recent Highlights

- 🎤 Speaker at **Guidewire DevSummit 2025** — Presented Fern, an open-source test reporting tool
- 🏆 **Google Agentic AI Day Finalist** — Designed autonomous agents under competition constraints
- 📄 **Published Researcher** — [4 publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6il-Qi8AAAAJ&hl=en) including work on deep learning for satellite imagery and DNA sequence classification
